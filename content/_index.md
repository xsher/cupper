### Hi, I am Sherly.
Although, most of the time I go by Sherly Sherly.

My interests lies in the field of Data Science and Engineering.

I am an ex-Software Engineer at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) and ex-Data Scientist both at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) and [Go-Jek](https://go-jek.com/). I am currently pursuing my Double Masters in Data Science under EIT Digital Masters Programme at [Polytech Nice Sophia](http://mastercs.unice.fr/). I am heading to [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) for my second year 2019\/20 this August.

I am currently interning with [Team SPARKS](http://sparks.i3s.unice.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Frédéric Precioso](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso) and [Melissa Sanabria](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~sanabria/). I am working with video data for this research project.

If you are interested to hire an intern or a full-timer right at the start of 2020, feel free to peruse my profile at [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sherlysherly).
